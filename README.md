# Number Classification API

This API classifies a number based on its mathematical properties and provides an interesting fun fact about it. The API is built using **Node.js** and **Express**, and it handles CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow access from different origins.

## Features
- Classify a number as **prime**, **perfect**, **Armstrong**, **odd**, or **even**.
- Provide a **fun fact** about the number using the Numbers API.
- Handle CORS for cross-origin requests.

## API Endpoint

### `GET /api/classify-number`

Classify a given number based on its mathematical properties.

**Query Parameters:**
- `number` (required) - The number you want to classify.

#### Example Request:

```
GET http://localhost:3000/api/classify-number?number=371
```

#### Example Response (200 OK):

```json
{
    "number": 371,
    "is_prime": false,
    "is_perfect": false,
    "properties": ["armstrong", "odd"],
    "digit_sum": 11,
    "fun_fact": "371 is an Armstrong number because 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 371"
}
```

#### Example Response (400 Bad Request - Invalid Input):

```json
{
    "number": "alphabet",
    "error": true
}
```

## Mathematical Properties

The API checks for the following mathematical properties:

- **Prime**: A number greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself.
- **Perfect**: A number that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding the number itself).
- **Armstrong**: A number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.
- **Even/Odd**: Whether the number is even (divisible by 2) or odd.

## CORS Support

The API supports **CORS** to allow cross-origin requests. This means that you can make API requests from a different domain or port (e.g., a frontend running on `http://localhost:3001` can make requests to the API running on `http://localhost:3000`).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/number-classification-api.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd number-classification-api
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Testing the API

You can test the API using any HTTP client (like **Postman**, **Insomnia**, or your browser).

Example using `curl`:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/classify-number?number=371"
```

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime to run the server.
- **Express**: Framework for building the API.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the Numbers API for fun facts.
- **CORS**: To handle cross-origin requests.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes and commit (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to your branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Open a pull request.
